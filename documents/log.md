## December 02 2023

### Goals
1. Complete Linear Algebra functions (completed)
2. Add more tests to further verify Linear Algebra functions (in progress)
3. Implement Graph Conversion functions (completed)
4. Implement Graph Construction constructor (completed)
5. Integrate Facebook data

### Tasks Completed
-Ahmed finished the graph conversion algorithm functions and also added helper functions to help process CSV files

-Added tests to make algorithm correctness assessments more thorough

-General graphs of `##vertices.csv` work correctly as per new tests

-Fully implemented processInput()

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)
Having implemented the custom generated csv files, what is the best way to add Facebook/external graphs within our program?

### Future Plans
(1) Build tests for real-world inputs

## November 29 2023

### Goals
1. Complete Linear Algebra functions (completed)
2. Add more tests to further verify Linear Algebra functions
3. Implement Graph Conversion functions (mostly complete)
4. Implement Graph Construction constructor

### Tasks Completed
Implemented most of the graph conversion algorithm and also added additional necessary functions.
Implemented processInput (needs tweaking).

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)
How to ignore the first data value of each row of the csv file (the row index)?

### Future Plans
(1) (Hopefully) get a working program for trivial .csv files so then we can advance to realistic inputs.
(2) Build larger tests

3. Implement Graph Conversion functions
4. Implement Graph Construction constructor

### Tasks Completed
Implemented the linear algebra functions. However, more thorough testing needs to happen.

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)
It is a bit tricky to work with .csv files, how can we easily integrate csv files into our program?

### Future Plans
