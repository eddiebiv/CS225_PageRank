## November 27 2023

### Goals
1. Complete Linear Algebra functions (completed)
2. Add more tests to further verify Linear Algebra functions
3. Implement Graph Conversion functions
4. Implement Graph Construction constructor

### Tasks Completed
Eddie was able to successfully implement the linear algebra functions. However, more thorough testing needs to happen.

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)
It is a bit tricky to work with .csv files, how can we easily integrate csv files into our program?

### Plans for next week
(Hopefully) get a working program for trivial .csv files so then we can advance to realistic inputs.

### Goals
1. Complete Linear Algebra functions (completed)
2. Add more tests to further verify Linear Algebra functions
3. Implement Graph Conversion functions (mostly complete)
4. Implement Graph Construction constructor

### Tasks Completed
Ahmed implemented most of the graph conversion algorithm and also added additional necessary functions. 

### Issues encountered (Questions for mentors)
N/A

### Plans for next week
(1) (Hopefully) get a working program for trivial .csv files so then we can advance to realistic inputs.
(2) Build larger tests
